  "profileName": "Pure: Magic",
  "profileNotes": "The Magic Pure build is focused on maximizing magic damage while keeping other combat stats minimal to maintain a low combat level. This build aims for 99 Magic for the highest spell accuracy and damage, making it ideal for activities such as player-versus-player (PvP) combat, magic-based bossing, or high-level spell casting. The Attack level is set at 75 for using high-tier weapons like the Staff of the Dead, which can enhance magic damage. With minimal Defence, Ranged, and Prayer, this build keeps combat level low while specializing in magic-based combat.",
