  "profileName": "Tank: Poison",
  "profileNotes": "The Tank: Poison build is designed to maximize defense while using poison-based tactics to deal damage over time. With a focus on level 99 Defence, this build ensures high survivability, allowing the player to sustain poison damage on enemies while avoiding direct combat. Prayer level 52 enables the use of protection and damage-boosting prayers, while high Hitpoints further increases the character's durability. This build is ideal for long, sustained fights where poison can slowly weaken the enemy over time.",
