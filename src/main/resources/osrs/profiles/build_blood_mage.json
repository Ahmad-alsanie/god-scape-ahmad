  "profileName": "Build: Blood Mage",
  "profileNotes": "The Blood Mage is a magic-focused build that utilizes the Ancient Magicks spellbook to cast Blood spells like Blood Barrage. This build is designed for sustained combat, as the Blood spells heal the caster while dealing damage to the target. With 99 Magic, the Blood Mage maximizes the potential of these spells. The build also features moderate Defence to withstand hits and high Prayer for protection prayers and increased accuracy. Ideal for PvP situations and PvM content where self-sustain is valuable.",
