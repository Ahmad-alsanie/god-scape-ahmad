  "profileName": "Pure: Glass Cannon",
  "profileNotes": "This Glass Cannon Pure build is designed for maximum offensive power with minimal Defence, making it highly effective in high-risk PvP situations where speed and damage output are prioritized over survivability. The build maximizes Strength, Ranged, Magic, and Hitpoints for optimal damage potential while keeping Defence at level 1 to maintain the lowest possible combat level. Attack is set at 75 to allow the use of powerful weapons like the Godsword or Saradomin Sword. The Prayer level is set to 52, providing access to Smite and other useful offensive prayers. Recommended equipment includes an Armadyl Godsword, Magic Shortbow, and Ancient Magicks for a versatile combination of melee, ranged, and magic attacks.",
