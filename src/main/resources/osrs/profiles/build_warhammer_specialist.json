  "profileName": "Build: Warhammer Specialist",
  "profileNotes": "The Warhammer Specialist focuses on utilizing the Dragon Warhammer's special attack to significantly reduce an opponent's Defense. This build is highly effective in group PvM content, where breaking down a boss's Defense is crucial, as well as in PvP for softening up opponents for a team's finishing blows. The build features high Strength for maximum melee damage, moderate Defense to stay resilient, and enough Prayer for powerful prayers like 'Smite' or 'Protect from Melee'.",
